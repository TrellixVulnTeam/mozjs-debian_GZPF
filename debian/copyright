License: AFL-2.1+
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
 authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
 following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
 Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
 .
 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
 following:
 .
 a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
 .
 b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
 Work;
 .
 c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
 public;
 .
 d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 .
 e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
 claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
 Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
 Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
 form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
 documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
 agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
 Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
 Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
 machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
 reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
 long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
 the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
 the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
 .
 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
 of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
 service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
 Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
 in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
 patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
 expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
 offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
 defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
 such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
 interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
 License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
 license.
 .
 5) This section intentionally omitted.
 .
 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
 Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
 Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
 descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
 the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
 Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 modified the Original Work.
 .
 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
 the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
 by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
 of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
 and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
 sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
 and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
 This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
 license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
 .
 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
 Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
 or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
 or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
 of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
 apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
 negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
 jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
 consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
 a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
 obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
 else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
 grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
 or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
 to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
 between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
 equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
 exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
 Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
 and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
 as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
 against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
 patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
 patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
 hardware.
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
 License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
 Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
 the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
 scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
 requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
 seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
 section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
 seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
 recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
 attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
 any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
 License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
 the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
 make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
 in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
 under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
 entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
 under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
 (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
 entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
 (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
 entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
 restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
 to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
